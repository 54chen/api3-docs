Using Docker is the easiest way to both deploy an Airnode to a cloud provider and to run an Airnode locally. There are two Docker images: the Airnode deployer image and the Airnode client image. To use these images first install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if it is not present on your system.

- The [Airnode deployer image](./deployer-image.md) deploys the node in the form of serverless functions to a serverless cloud provider (e.g. AWS Lambda). 

- The [Airnode client image](client-image.md) is the node itself, containerized. The container can be run locally or deployed to a cloud hosting service (e.g. AWS EC2 or Lightsail). 

## DockerHub

Both the Airnode client image and deployer image are available on DockerHub. It is not required to download these manually. When you run the Docker commands provided these images will be downloaded to Docker automatically.

- [Airnode deployer image](https://hub.docker.com/r/api3/airnode-deployer) 
- [Airnode client image](https://hub.docker.com/r/api3/airnode-client)

## Cloud Provider Credentials

In order to deploy Airnode to a serverless cloud provider like AWS, you need to provide could provider credentials to the Airnode deployer image. The deployer image currently supports deploying to AWS. If you are new to AWS watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KngM5bfpttA) to set up an AWS account.
