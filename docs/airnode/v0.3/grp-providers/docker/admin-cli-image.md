We have already prepared a docker image for you and published it on docker hub.
If you want to build the container from the source yourself, you can find the
image and built instructions in the Airnode repository.

## Usage

The usage and available CLI commands are described in the
[admin CLI docs](../../../v0.2/reference/packages/admin-cli-commands.html#using-docker)
