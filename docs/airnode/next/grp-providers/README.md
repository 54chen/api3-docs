An **API Provider** is you, if you wish to publish data from your API to on-chain contracts which are called requesters. You can do so by building an Airnode. An Airnode is a first-party oracle that will push off-chain API data to any on-chain requester. See the [Developer](../grp-developers/) section to learn more about how developers will use your Airnode.

See the [Guides](guides/build-an-airnode/api-integration.md) section in the API Provider docs to build the necessary files required to deploy an Airnode. The diagram below illustrates the basic steps to successfully deploy an Airnode.

In summary you only need to do a few things.

- Create cloud provider account if you do not have one.
- Get a blockchain provider URL for the chain you wish to use (mainnet and/or testnet).
- Create the config.json (with an OIS object) and secrets.env files that defines your Airnode.
- Run the Docker image to deploy your Airnode.
