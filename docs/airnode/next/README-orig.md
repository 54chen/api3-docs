title: The Airnode

# {{$frontmatter.title}}

At its core, **API3** brings the ability for API providers to easily run their own _oracle nodes_. This allows them to provide their data on-chain, without an intermediary, to any _decentralized app_ \(dApp\) interested in their services.

At the heart of this mechanism sits **Airnode**, an open-source oracle node. It's designed to be easily deployed by any API provider with almost no maintenance. Because of Airnode, dApp developers can write _smart contracts_ to interact with the on-chain data of API providers.

Airnode is designed with mechanisms to remove the on-chain or off-chain concerns of API providers. The set-and-forget framework of Airnode is all about ease of implementation.
