# {{$frontmatter.title}}

Consider joining the distributed, highly collaborative Core Development Team at
API3. We are constantly searching for talented individuals who think blockchain
technology is _the big thing_ and want to build a future where off-chain,
real-world data seamlessly interfaces with smart contracts and decentralized
applications.

## We are Builders

The Core Development Team is focused on delivering optimized solutions to
securely, efficiently, and transparently access off-chain data. We are pioneers
in first-party oracle technology that underlies a growing ecosystem of
institutions participating in the Web3 API economy. In addition to working in
public and releasing open source software, the Core Development Team embraces
automation, experimentation, multi-hat roles, high standards, and supporting one
another.
