# {{$frontmatter.title}}

Consider working with the Core Development Team at API3. Our search for you is
never ending. We want talented individuals that think blockchain technology is
_the big thing_, that are ready to make it better and embrace collaboration as
an endless journey.

## We are DevOps

The Core Development Team is all about DevOps. It is our way of getting the job
done. The industry we thrive in has quickly gone from asking what DevOps is, to
asking how can it help organizations. Motivations for adopting DevOps
methodologies are varied. Our Core Development Team embraces automation,
experimentation, multi-hat roles, supporting each other and building it right.
