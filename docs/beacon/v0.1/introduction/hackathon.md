Experience API3 **Beacons** at ETHDenver (February 11-20, 2022) during
[#BUIDLWEEK](https://www.ethdenver.com/buidlweek).

## Versions

API3 has set up Beacons (supported by Airnodes) using the following versions.

- Airnode version `v0.3.1`
- Beacon version `v0.1.0`

Access Beacons using the `RrpBeaconSerever.sol` contract. Specific network
addresses for the contract are in the
[Contract Addresses](../reference/contract-addresses.md) section. For
_#BUIDLWEEK_ please use either the Rinkeby or Mumbai network.

## Amberdata

[Amberdata](https://amberdata.io) has connected some of their great API
endpoints to API3 Beacons for _#BUIDLWEEK_. A special thank you to Amberdata.

Prior to _#BUIDLWEEK_ the [Beacon Catalog](../reference/beacon-catalog.md) will
have a list of 10 Beacons each (supplied by Amberdata) for the Rinkeby and
Mumbai networks only.
